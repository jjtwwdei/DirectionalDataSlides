First week's class notes.
The source file in all cases is the emacs org-mode file.  Org can export directly to html and markdown, and (via latex) to pdf (including beamer presentations).  These files are included in the repository.  Another interesting tool is [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which can convert between many document formats.  In particular, pandoc will also convert emacs org-mode files to html, markdown, and pdf (again via latex), and those files are included here for comparison.
