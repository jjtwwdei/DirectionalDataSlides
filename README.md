# DirectionalDataSlides
First week's class notes.
The source file in all cases is the emacs [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) file.  Org can export directly to html and markdown, and (via latex) to pdf (including beamer presentations).  These files are included in the repository.  Another interesting tool is [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which can convert between many document formats.  In particular, pandoc will also convert emacs org-mode files to html, markdown, and pdf (again via latex), and those files are included here for comparison.

Interestingly, it's not easy to view the html files on github.  One work around is to use htmlpreview.github.com.  Just add the url of the html file to htmlpreview.github.com/?, e.g.,

[htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/presnell/DirectionalDataSlides/blob/master/directionalData.html](htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/presnell/DirectionalDataSlides/blob/master/directionalData.html)
